# SVD application - Color image compression

* Singular Value Decomposition algorithm compresses images by retaining essential
features and discarding insignificant ones, resulting in high-quality compressed
images.
* The program also offers the option to display both the original and compressed images
side by side for comparison.
* By using SVD, the program can efficiently reduce the dimensionality of the image while
maintaining the image's quality and integrity.
